## 1. Flutter Development Protocol

Every Flutter task follows this pipeline:

1. **Understand** — Read the requirement. Clarify ambiguity before writing code.
2. **Architect** — Choose architecture pattern (clean arch for features, simple for prototypes).
3. **Scaffold** — Create directory structure, define models, interfaces, and routes.
4. **Implement** — Write code feature-by-feature, smallest testable unit first.
5. **Test** — Widget tests for every screen, unit tests for logic, integration tests for flows.
6. **Analyze** — Run `flutter analyze` — zero warnings, zero errors.
7. **Verify** — Run on device/emulator. Check both light AND dark themes.
8. **Deploy** — Build release, test release mode, deliver.

### Mandatory Commands Before Claiming Done

```bash
flutter analyze          # Must show: No issues found!
flutter test             # Must show: All tests passed!
dart format lib/ test/   # Code must be formatted
```

### Dart 3.7-3.10 Language Features

| Feature | Dart | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Wildcard `_` | 3.7 | `for (final (name, _, _) in records)` |
| New formatter | 3.7 | Better trailing comma handling |
| Null-aware collections | 3.8 | `[?Text(subtitle), ...?extraTags]` |
| Dot shorthands | 3.10 | `.all(16)` instead of `EdgeInsets.all(16)` |
| Augmentations | 3.10 | Replaces cancelled macros, same codegen workflow |
| Build hooks | 3.10 | Native code compilation without shell scripts |

See `references/dart-modern-features.md` for full examples and migration tips.

### Decision: When NOT to Use Flutter

- Pure backend service -> Use Dart server (shelf/dart_frog) or other backend
- Simple static website -> Use HTML/CSS or Next.js
- Heavy 3D graphics -> Use Unity/Unreal with Flutter embedding
- Native-only feature -> Write platform channel, not pure Flutter

### When to Use Clean Architecture

| Project Size | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Prototype / POC | Single folder, no layers. Speed over structure. |
| Small app (< 5 screens) | Feature folders with simple separation. |
| Medium app (5-20 screens) | Full clean architecture per feature. |
| Enterprise app (20+ screens) | Clean architecture + modular packages. |

---

## 3. State Management Decision Tree

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Simple local UI state (toggle, counter) | `setState` / `ValueNotifier` | Minimal overhead, no dependencies |
| Form state with validation | `TextEditingController` + `ValueNotifier` | Built-in, no extra packages |
| Feature-level state with async | **Riverpod 3.0** | Compile-time safety, auto-disposal, no BuildContext |
| Enterprise/regulated app (audit trail) | **BLoC 9.0** | Event-driven, strict separation, replay/undo |
| Legacy app with existing Provider | **Provider** | Don't rewrite what works |
| Global app state (auth, theme, locale) | **Riverpod** | Dependency injection built-in, testable |
| Real-time data (WebSocket, Firestore) | **Riverpod StreamProvider** or **BLoC** | Stream-native support |
| Complex UI with many interdependent states | **Riverpod** | Provider composition, granular rebuilds |

### Key Rule: Never Mix State Management Libraries

Pick ONE primary state management solution per project. Using Riverpod + BLoC + Provider in the same app creates confusion.
